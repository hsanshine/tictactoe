# tictactoe

First personal project in Python. I wrote this program drunk on christmas night. i was motivated by the christmas spirit and I wanted my and I friends to have a simple game to play that night.

I figured it would be cool to play tictactoe on the computer but the Xs and Os seemed boring so I opted for Fire and Ice emojis instead because it was snowing outside and also because fire and Ice seemed like good opposites to me. Well it turned out pretty challenging writing code in a new language while only a quarter of your brain seems to function. Was an amazing experience.
